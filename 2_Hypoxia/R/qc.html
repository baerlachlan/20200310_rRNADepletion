<p>Gene-level counts were determined with <code>featureCounts</code> from the <code>subread</code> package.</p>
<p>RNA-seq libraries can be stranded to determine whether the read represents the plus or the minus strand, and therefore the orientation of the transcript. Often this information is not provided by the sequencing provider unless explicitly asked. <code>featureCounts</code> requires specification of the strandedness of the library for best results. When strandedness information is unknown, we can run <code>featureCounts</code> with all three possible options (stranded, unstranded, reverse-stranded), and assess the assignment rates to infer the strandedness of the original library. Unltimately we choose the <code>featureCounts</code> output with the highest assignment rate.</p>

<p>Description of <code>featureCounts</code> unassigned read types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unassigned Unmapped: unmapped reads cannot be assigned.</li>
<li>Unassigned Read Type: reads that have an unexpected read type (eg. being a single end read included in a paired end dataset) and also cannot be counted with confidence (eg. due to stranded counting). Such reads are typically generated from a read trimming program.</li>
<li>Unassigned Singleton: read pairs that have only one end mapped.</li>
<li>Unassigned MappingQuality: alignments with a mapping quality score lower than the threshold.</li>
<li>Unassigned Chimera: two ends in a paired end alignment are located on different chromosomes or have unexpected orientation.</li>
<li>Unassigned FragementLength: fragment length inferred from paired end alignment does not meet the length criteria.</li>
<li>Unassigned Duplicate: alignments marked as duplicate (indicated in the FLAG field).</li>
<li>Unassigned MultiMapping: alignments reported for multi-mapping reads (indicated by ‘NH’ tag).</li>
<li>Unassigned Secondary: alignments reported as secondary alignments (indicated in the FLAG field).</li>
<li>Unassigned Split (or Unassigned NonSplit): alignments that contain junctions (or do not contain junctions).</li>
<li>Unassigned NoFeatures: alignments that do not overlap any feature.</li>
<li>Unassigned Overlapping Length: alignments that do not overlap any feature (or metafeature) with the minimum required overlap length.</li>
<li>Unassigned Ambiguity: alignments that overlap two or more features (feature-level summarization) or meta-features (meta-feature-level summarization).</li>
