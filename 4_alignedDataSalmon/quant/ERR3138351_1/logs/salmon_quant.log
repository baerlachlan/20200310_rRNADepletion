[2020-04-23 14:13:13.917] [jointLog] [info] Computed 2,256 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-04-23 14:13:13.917] [jointLog] [info] Counted 255,258 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-23 14:13:14.004] [jointLog] [warning] 2.20511% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
