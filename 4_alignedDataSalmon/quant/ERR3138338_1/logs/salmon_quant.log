[2020-04-23 13:33:00.787] [jointLog] [info] Counted 87,243 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-23 13:33:00.891] [jointLog] [warning] 2.03017% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
