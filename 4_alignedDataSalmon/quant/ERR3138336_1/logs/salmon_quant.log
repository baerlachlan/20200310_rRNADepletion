[2020-04-23 13:27:10.388] [jointLog] [info] Counted 136,513 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-23 13:27:10.474] [jointLog] [warning] 2.99387% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
