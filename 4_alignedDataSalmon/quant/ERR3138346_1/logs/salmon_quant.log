[2020-04-23 13:59:34.342] [jointLog] [info] Counted 288,191 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-23 13:59:34.427] [jointLog] [warning] 1.70748% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
