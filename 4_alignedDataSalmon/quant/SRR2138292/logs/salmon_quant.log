[2020-04-21 04:47:17.313] [jointLog] [info] Counted 7,458,113 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-21 04:47:17.324] [jointLog] [warning] 0.293147% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
