[2020-04-23 14:32:05.495] [jointLog] [info] Counted 189,742 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-23 14:32:05.570] [jointLog] [warning] 1.77578% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
