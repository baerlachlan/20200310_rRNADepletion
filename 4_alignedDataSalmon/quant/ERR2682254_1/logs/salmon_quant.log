[2020-04-23 12:53:58.848] [jointLog] [info] Counted 153,279 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-23 12:53:58.932] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00511907% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
