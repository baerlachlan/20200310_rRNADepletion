[2020-04-23 13:43:06.372] [jointLog] [info] Computed 1,894 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-04-23 13:43:06.372] [jointLog] [info] Counted 119,881 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-23 13:43:06.458] [jointLog] [warning] 1.95395% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
