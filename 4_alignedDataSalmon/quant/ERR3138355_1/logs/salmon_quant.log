[2020-04-23 14:26:04.333] [jointLog] [info] Counted 132,392 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-23 14:26:04.429] [jointLog] [warning] 2.22932% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
