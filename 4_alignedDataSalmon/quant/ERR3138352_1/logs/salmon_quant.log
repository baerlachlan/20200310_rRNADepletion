[2020-04-23 14:16:34.722] [jointLog] [info] Counted 198,190 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-23 14:16:34.806] [jointLog] [warning] 1.88861% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
