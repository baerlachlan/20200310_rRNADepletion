[2020-04-23 13:23:14.078] [jointLog] [info] Counted 62,060 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-23 13:23:14.187] [jointLog] [warning] 3.89683% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
