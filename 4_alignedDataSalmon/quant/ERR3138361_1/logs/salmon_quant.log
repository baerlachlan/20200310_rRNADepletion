[2020-04-23 14:44:22.300] [jointLog] [info] Counted 143,458 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-23 14:44:22.385] [jointLog] [warning] 3.90722% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
