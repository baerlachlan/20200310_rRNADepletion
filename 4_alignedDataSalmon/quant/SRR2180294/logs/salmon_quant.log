[2020-04-21 04:50:32.169] [jointLog] [info] Counted 7,475,936 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-21 04:50:32.180] [jointLog] [warning] 0.417443% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
