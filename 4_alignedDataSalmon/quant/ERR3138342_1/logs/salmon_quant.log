[2020-04-23 13:46:28.232] [jointLog] [info] Computed 1,992 rich equivalence classes for further processing
[2020-04-23 13:46:28.232] [jointLog] [info] Counted 77,871 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-23 13:46:28.332] [jointLog] [warning] 1.83803% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
