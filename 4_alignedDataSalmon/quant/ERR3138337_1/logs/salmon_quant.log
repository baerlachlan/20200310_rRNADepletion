[2020-04-23 13:29:52.632] [jointLog] [info] Counted 67,476 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-23 13:29:52.739] [jointLog] [warning] 4.02393% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
