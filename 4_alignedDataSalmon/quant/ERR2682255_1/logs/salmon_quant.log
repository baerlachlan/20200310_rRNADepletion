[2020-04-23 12:57:15.189] [jointLog] [info] Counted 153,032 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2020-04-23 12:57:15.271] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00523357% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index.
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 15.
